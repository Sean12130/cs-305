Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial creates personalized financial plans and wanted to enhance web application security. They needed to add file verification, encryption, and transition to HTTPS for secure client data protection.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I improved the code by making it more secure, which included adding better ways for information to be sent and making sure it's all encrypted. This is important for keeping sensitive data safe from unauthorized access and possible security breaches. It also helps to build and keep client trust and makes sure we're following the rules.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

One challenge was ensuring the updated code met security requirements without adding new vulnerabilities. The use of tools like Java Keytool for certificate generation and the dependency-check tool for static analysis to verify and validate code was one helpful aspect.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I enhanced security by adding encryption algorithms, implementing checksum verification, and transitioning the application from HTTP to HTTPS. In the future, I plan to use tools like vulnerability assessment, static and dynamic analysis, and code reviews to assess vulnerabilities.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured functionality and security by performing thorough functional testing and secondary static testing using the dependency-check tool.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I utilized Java Keytool for generating self-signed certificates, the dependency-check tool for static code analysis, and cryptographic hash algorithms for secure data verification. These resources and practices will be valuable for future assignments by maintaining and enhancing software security.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would present the refactored code with its enhanced security features with encryption and HTTPS implementation, along with a detailed practices for secure software report. This report would highlight the comprehensive approach I took to secure the software by including vulnerability assessment, code refactoring, and testing results.
